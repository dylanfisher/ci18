### Writing more code than necessary

One of the quickest ways to make your life difficult as a programmer is through your
own code you write, especially writing more code than necessary.

[Keep it simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

### Mixing coding practices

Don't resort to inlining CSS or JavaScript. Keep your styles (CSS) and interactions (JavaScript) separate from your HTML.
If you have trouble linking these properly, or your styles aren't being applied, figure out why you are having this issue,
don't solve it by inlining it directly in your HTML.

### Use simple tools

For the sake of this class please use jQuery when handling events and DOM manipulation as it's easy to read
and understand. Understand the difference between vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, and when it's more convenient
to use one over the other.
