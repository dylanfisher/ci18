### Instructions

1. Use InDesign for presentation decks.
2. Create a new file, select "Web" from intent, and use a comfortable aspect ratio (16:9 or 16:10) for the dimensions. I like to use 1440 &#215; 900.
3. Hit OK.
4. Create your file. For presentation decks, I'm expecting one page with a title and description of your concept, one to three pages with references and inspiration, and one or two pages with initial sketches or execution ideas.
5. To export, press command E and save as "Adobe PDF (Interactive)."
6. To check the size of your PDF, find it in your finder and view your folder in list view. The size should show up in one of the panels.
7. All PDFs being uploaded to GitHub should be less than 6 mb.
