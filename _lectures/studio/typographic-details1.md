### Typographic Details

The words you chose deserve to be read. Typesetting helps bring focus to these words, and correct use of punctuation helps your words shine.

### Check for...

1. Spacing. You should always have one space in-between sentences, not two.

2. Quotes. Curly quotes in both singles and pairs are used for dialogue and direct quotations. Frequently, these quotes get confused and replaced with inch and feet marks. You can tell the difference because these ones are straight.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Hello everyone! I&rsquo;m ready for the weekend,&rdquo; she said.<br><span style="color:green">*correct*</span><br><br>
&#34;Hello everyone! I&#39;m ready for the weekend,&#34;  she said.<br> <span style="color:red">*incorrect*</span>
<br><br>
The teacher is 5&#39;6&#34;<br><span style="color:green">*correct*</span><br><br>
The teacher is 5&rsquo;6&rdquo;;<br> <span style="color:red">*incorrect*</span>
<br><br>
Use `&lsquo;` and `&rsquo;` for &lsquo;left and right&rsquo; single curly quotes.<br>
Use `&ldquo;` and `&rdquo;` for &ldquo;left and right&rdquo; double curly quotes.<br>
<br>
Use `&#34;` and `&#39;` for inch&#39; and feet&#34; marks.<br>
<br>

3. Hyphens. There are three types of hyphens: &mdash;em dashes, &ndash;en dashes, and -hyphens. They all serve different purposes and vary in length.<br><br>
A <span style="color:blue">hyphen (-)</span> is the shortest of the three and is used to make any compound adjectives clear. Hyphens are inserted by hitting the hyphen key on your keyboard.<br>
<br>I&rsquo;ll write him an e<span style="color:blue">-</span>mail about sugar<span style="color:blue">-</span>free soda consumption in the twenty<span style="color:blue">-</span>first century.<br>
T<span style="color:blue">-</span>Pain
<br><br>
An <span style="color:Fuchsia">en-dash (&ndash;)</span> is used to connect values in a range or that are related. A good rule is to use it when you're expressing a "to" relationship. Use `&ndash;` to achieve this symbol.
<br><br>The years 1945<span style="color:Fuchsia">&ndash;</span>1960<br>
The Cowboys beat The Raiders 20<span style="color:Fuchsia">&ndash;</span>19
<br><br>
An <span style="color:OrangeRed">em-dash (&mdash;)</span> is used to interrupt a sentence, or in place of commas and parentheses. American style uses no spaces<span style="color:OrangeRed">&mdash;</span>like this<span style="color:OrangeRed">&mdash;</span>around em dashes, but British style does use spaces. We&rsquo;ll go over this in *Typographic Details Volume 2*.
Use `&mdash;` to achieve this symbol.
<br><br>I wish you would<span style="color:OrangeRed">&mdash;</span>oh, nevermind.<br>
It takes two to tango<span style="color:OrangeRed">&mdash;</span>one to dance and one to boogie!

4. Your turn: Typeset the following sentences correctly:<br><br>
Thanks for recommending that song, Ignition (Remix) by R. Kelly. I know it reached its peak from 2003-2005 Im still into it.
Back in those days, I was only 5"2" and my favorite band was o town.
