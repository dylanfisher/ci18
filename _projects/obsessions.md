### Instructions

1. For this project we’re going to make a personal archive. The archive should contain 70–100 different pieces in it. The content of the archive is entirely up to you and should reflect one of your interests or ruminations. The content can be found, your own, or a combination of both.
2. Think about how the archive is organized (or disorganized).
3. The project must include a visual component: photos, illustrations, etc.4. Start with a user flow that shows how the user will go through your website. Consider 3 different paths the user could take to navigate your content. Which path is the most expected? Which path offers the most opportunities for experimentation? Be sure to consider how the active gesture of clicking will impact the user.
4. Consider how the user interacts with your archive, and how the archive is experienced. Is it immediately accessible in its entirety, or is the user required to discover it? All of these choices should be considered and reflect your concept.
5. The project is required to have at least two views: a full archive as well as a detail view that has different information.
6. You should be able to go through the archive in at least two different ways.
7. Project must have a title and a favicon.
8. Project must have at least two views: one where you can see all of the content and one where you can view each item in another way with metadata included.
9. You will be graded on concept, execution, and consistency.

### Goals

The goals of this project are to work with a multiplicity of items and learn to create a seamless and coherent story using your design. Unlike the previous project, Obsessions requires designer&rsquo;s to use a visual component and to examine all the factors that go into making something consistent in many different ways. Additionally, the project introduces students to metadata and asks them to begin thinking about how to use additional information to add a memorable layer of content to the project. Lastly, the project asks students to examine their own interests and aesthetics and to apply it to a project. The best projects will go beyond what&rsquo;s literally being asked of them and take on their own twist!

##Technical Requirements
1. Wesite must be responsive work on a variety of screen sizes. The mobile view should feel considered and add to the story.
2. Archive must change in some way with interaction.

### Deadlines

This project is your midterm. The final crit will be on March 30th. Check agenda for increments.
