### Instructions

1. I’d like you to imagine a website as a destination. The destination should be fictitious, but should have a reason for existing. Think about how one feels when they land on the page, what kind of information is necessary to communicate the goal of the vacation, and how the experience of being in the destination changes over time. How does time pass at your dream vacation? The website should feel alive and self-aware. The website can take the form of an environment, but doesn’t have to. You are also allowed to bring in any content (existing or imaginary) to the assignment, as long as it supports your idea.
In addition, the website should have a differentiated experience on mobile than it does on a widescreen that supports your concept.
2. Project must have a title and a favicon.
3. Extra credit: In addition to the website, design a supporting asset that announces the project. You can design a double-sided printed postcard, or, an animation to be posted on social media with the same purpose. Either asset must include the URL to the project. Be prepared to explain why you chose a printed or digital component.


### Technical Requirements

- Must use Javascript or jQuery in some capacity
- Must work on a variety of break points
- Must respond to time in a poetic manner
- Must respond to device in a poetic manner (It should feel like a different but related experience on a small screen size)
