### Overview

1. Each week one student will give a 5-10 minute presentation on a topic of interest to the class. This can take the form of a
   website, new technology, exhibition, current event, or something else entirely.
2. Be prepared to discuss why you chose this item to share, and how it relates the class.
3. If your topic involves the web, consider researching what techniques or software were used to create the website. If you wanted to do something similar, what would be involved?
