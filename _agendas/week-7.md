### Tuesday, Studio

- Observe lecture about [Mobile Design and Responsive Design](/assets/lectures/lecture-6-mobile-design.pdf)
- In class activity: Work in pairs and find an example of a website that has a nice transition to a smaller screen size. Document both versions with descriptions on why you think it&rsquo;s an effective transition. Share with class.
- Work on revising your desktop designs to work on a variety of screen sizes. Analyze what will need to change. Aside from the literal differences, is there a separate part of your experience that should be different when accessed on a mobile design?


### Homework
- Continue working on your projects, come to class with a revised version that includes what it looks like on mobile. All should be uploaded to InVision at the start of class.
