### Tuesday, Studio

- Observe lecture about [Mobile Design and Responsive Design](/assets/lectures/lecture-6-mobile-design.pdf)

- Work on revising your desktop designs to work on a variety of screen sizes. Analyze what will need to change. Aside from the literal differences, is there a separate part of your experience that should be different when accessed on a mobile design?
