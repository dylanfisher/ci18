### Homework

- For Tuesday 04/10 — bring a presentation in of your Masterpiece project. Include a "field notes" analysis of your artwork – who it&rsquo;s by, where it came from, what you like about it (2-3 slides), what you&rsquo;d like to highlight about your project (1-2 slides), and 3 COMPLETE designs of your project (not programmed, just on Invision). Each design should be conceptually and visually distinct.
