### Homework
- Create an InVision presentation for Obsessions. The presentation should include 3 different concepts for your project. Each concept should have about 4 pages: one page describing it with words and pictures, a mood board with examples of what you're trying to achieve. this should include research as well as inspiration (probably about 2 pages), and one rough homepage design exploring your topic. Around 12 pages total.
