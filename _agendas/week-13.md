### Homework

- Choose one direction to move forward with. Create three different iterations of that idea. Each iteration should be a sketch uploaded to InVision. Show as many screens as necessary to communicate the general idea of your project – if there are subpages, show what those could look like. If there is an interactive component on the homepage, show how that will work. I would imagine about 3 pages per direction (9 pages total). Please upload to InVision at the start of class.
- Yangchen is discussion leader, everyone else please [read What is Code by Paul Ford](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) and post a [question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yelAV-Etvn9qG8Pfjezel0LMnHYFZlk0rTlHygOu10c/edit?usp=sharing).
