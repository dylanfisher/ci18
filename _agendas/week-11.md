### Wednesday, Lab

- Soyeon and Yangchen share weekly interest.
- Lecture: [JavaScript Introduction](/lectures/lab/javascript-introduction)
- In-class JavaScript assignment:

Divide into groups of 3 or 4. Create a new HTML file and create a link to a main.js JavaScript file. Use that JavaScript file to complete each of these tasks in class:

1. Create a variable named `myWeekend` assigned to a string that describes something fun you did over the weekend.
1. Create a series of 6 math problems that all equal 66. For example, `6 * 11`.
1. Create a series of arrays that represent each of the work session groups. Each student should be one item in the array. Assign these arrays to variables.
1. Create a variable named `allStudentsHere` and assign it a boolean value representing whether or not all the students are present today.
1. Create a variable named `studentsMissing` and assign it an array with a list of each student that is missing. Use `console.log()` to log the number of students that are missing from class.
1. Bonus: Create a an array of each of the work session groups from number 3 (an array of arrays) and loop through this array using a for loop. Use `console.log()` to log the index of the working group. Inside that for loop, create an additional for loop that logs each of the students in that working group.

### Weekly Interest

- Khe starts next class with weekly interest.
- Prepare for next week’s in-class javascript quiz by reviewing the [JavaScript Introduction](/lectures/lab/javascript-introduction) lecture and reading the “Read more” links at the bottom of each section.
